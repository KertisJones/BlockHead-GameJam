Jesse Riggins, Jon Brown, and Karre's submission for ILS-Z399 Game Jame "Squares, Boxes, and Cubes"


Inspired by Doodle Jump, this is an endless jumper where you continually climb the falling boxes.
As the speed increases over time, you must make your jumps both acurrately and quickly to avoid falling.

A and D to move, any other key to jump.
Move off the edge of the screen to appear on the other side.
